# [itp-w1] Bubble Sort

This project is to reproduce a sorting algorithm called a "bubble sort" using the control flow.
You will need to use nesting to achieve this:

Read about bubble sort here:

It goes through and checks if a number in the list is higher than the next number. If so, it switches the two.
It does this until all the numbers are in the right order.

Do not use the .sort or the .sorted method to do this.


```python
>>> bubble_sort([1, 3, 2, 6, 5])
[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
>>> bubble_sort([3, 2, 1])
[1, 2, 3]
```
