This project is to reproduce a sorting algorithm called a "bubble sort" using simple control flow structures.
You will need to use nested loops to achieve this:

It goes through and checks if a number in the list is higher than the next number. If so, it switches the two.
It does this until all the numbers are in increasing order.

Do not use the .sort or the .sorted method to do this.


```python
>>> bubble_sort([1, 3, 2, 6, 5])
[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
>>> bubble_sort([3, 2, 1])
[1, 2, 3]
```
